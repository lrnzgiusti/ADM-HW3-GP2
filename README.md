Here we put a brief description of the files contained in the repository:


__ADM-HW3-GP2.ipynb:__ This contains the outputs of the search engine. Mainly there are the function calls and the visualization of the outputs, at the end we put two technical appendixes for a little explaination of what we have done in the background and some theoretical stuffs. <br>

__search_engine.py:__ This is the library that contains all the classes and all the useful functions for handle the search engine. The private methods are only for internal use.

__map/reduce_1.py:__ These are the scripts for build the first inverted index with map-reduce framework, we prefer to run this instead of spark because the results are stored directly in the disk.

__map.html:__ The folium map for the bonus point, we saved it because of the problems of github in loading maps.
